%description
SUNDIALS is a SUite of Non-linear DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers
for use in writing mathematical software.

SUNDIALS was implemented with the goal of providing robust time integrators
and nonlinear solvers that can easily be incorporated into existing simulation
codes. The primary design goals were to require minimal information from the
user, allow users to easily supply their own data structures underneath the
solvers, and allow for easy incorporation of user-supplied linear solvers and
preconditioners. 

%package devel

%description devel
SUNDIALS is a SUite of Non-linear DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers
for use in writing mathematical software.

This package contains the developer files (.so file, header files)

%package static
Summary:    Suite of nonlinear solvers (static libraries)

Requires:   %{name}-devel = %{version}-%{release}
%description static
SUNDIALS is a SUite of Non-linear DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers
for use in writing mathematical software.

This package contains the static library files (.a files). These libraries
provide support for using SUNDIALS from Fortran.
